### Storage System Simulator

The **Storage System Simulator** is an intuitive and interactive web-based tool designed to simulate the working of storage systems efficiently. 
The first core entity in this simulator is the **System** object, which allows users to specify key performance parameters including 
**Max Throughput (in MB/s)** and **Max Capacity (in GB)**. 
With a sleek user interface, users can easily create new systems, view all configured systems, or delete them as needed.
