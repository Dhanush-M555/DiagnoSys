PROBLEM 1 : HIGH LATENCY DUE TO HIGH SYSTEM SATURATION

TESTCASE :

System 5001:
    Max Throughput=400MB/s
    Max Capacity=2500 GB

    Volumes:
        Volume1=125 GB
        Volume2=200 GB
        Volume3=150 GB

    Hosts:
        Host1 
        Host2 
        Host3

    Export Volumes:
        Volume1,Host1, workload_size(8KB), IOPS = 2000
        Volume2,Host2, workload_size(32KB), IOPS = 2000
        Volume3,Host3, workload_size(128KB), IOPS = 2000

INPUT : Why is volume v3 in System 5001 experiencing high latency?

CALCULATIONS FOR TESTCASE 1 :

1. Capacity Used:
Total = 125 + 200 + 150 = 475 GB
Capacity % = (475 / 2500) × 100 = 19.0%

2. Throughput per volume in MB/s (formula: (2000 * workload_size_in_KB) / 1024):
v1 (workload size : 8KB) → (2000 × 8) / 1024 = 15.625 MB/s
v2 (workload size : 32KB) → (2000 × 32) / 1024 = 62.5 MB/s
v3 (workload size : 128KB) → (2000 × 128) / 1024 = 250

3. Total Saturation = 15.625 + 62.5 + 250 = 328.125 MB/s
Saturation % = (328.125 / 400) × 100 = 82.03%

4. Volume Contributions:
v1: 125 GB = 5.0% of total capacity, 15.625 / 400 = 3.91% saturation
v2: 200 GB = 8.0% of total capacity, 62.5 / 400 = 15.62% saturation
v3: 150 GB = 6.0% of total capacity, 250 / 400 = 62.5% saturation

5. Bully Volume: Volume3 (128KB workload) — highest saturation % (62.5%)

SNAPSHOTS :
No snapshots are configured.

PROBLEM 2 : HIGH LATENCY DUE TO HIGH SYSTEM CAPACITY (SNAPSHOT OVERLOAD)

System 5002:
    Max Throughput = 300 MB/s
    Max Capacity = 2000 GB

    Volumes:
        Volume1 = 50 GB (With Snapshot settings: max_snapshots = 15, frequency = 5 secs)
        Volume2 = 300 GB (With Snapshot settings: max_snapshots = 1, frequency = 60 secs)
        Volume3 = 100 GB (With Snapshot settings: max_snapshots = 2, frequency = 30 secs)

    Hosts:
        Host1
        Host2

    Export Volumes:
        Volume1, Host1, workload_size = 32KB, IOPS = 2000
        Volume2, Host2, workload_size = 8KB, IOPS = 2000
        Volume3, Host1, workload_size = 4KB, IOPS = 2000

INPUT : Why is volume v1 in System 5002 experiencing high latency?

CALCULATIONS FOR TESTCASE 2:

1. Base Volume Capacity = 50 + 300 + 100 = 450 GB

2. Snapshot Storage =
v1: 50 GB × 15 = 750 GB
v2: 300 GB × 1 = 300 GB
v3: 100 GB × 2 = 200 GB
→ Snapshot total = 1250 GB

3. Total capacity used = 450 + 1250 = 1700 GB
Capacity % = (1700 / 2000) × 100 = 85.0%

4. Throughput per volume in MB/s (formula: (2000 * workload_size_in_KB) / 1024):
v1: workload_size - 32KB → (2000 × 32) / 1024 = 62.5 MB/s
v2: workload_size - 8KB → (2000 × 8) / 1024 = 15.625 MB/s
v3: workload_size - 4KB → (2000 × 4) / 1024 = 7.8125 MB/s

5. Volume Contributions (to total capacity):
v1: (50 + 750) = 800 GB = 40.0%
v2: (300 + 300) = 600 GB = 30.0%
v3: (100 + 200) = 300 GB = 15.0%

6. Bully Volume: v1 — 40% capacity, 15 snapshots → overload

    Hosts:
        Host1 

    Export Volumes:
        Volume1, Host1, workload_size(8KB), IOPS = 2000

INPUT : Why is volume v1 in System 5003 experiencing high latency?

2. Throughput = (IOPS * workload_size_in_KB) / 1024 = (2000 × 8KB) / 1024 = 15.625 MB/s
3. Saturation % = throughput / max_throughput × 100 = 15.625 / 350 = 4.46% 
4. Fault Injection: Permanent fault → impacts local system due to latency spike
