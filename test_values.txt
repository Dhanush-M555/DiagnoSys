1. High latency due to high system saturation

System 5000:
    Max Throughput=400MB/s
    Max Capacity=2500 GB

    Volumes:

    Volume1=125 GB
    Volume2=200 GB
    Volume3=150 GB

    Hosts:
    Host1 
    Host2 
    Host3

    Export Volumes:
        Volume1,Host1, workload_size(8KB)
        Volume2,Host2, workload_size(32KB)
        Volume3,Host3, workload_size(128KB)


2. High latency due to high system capacity(Volume Overload)

System 5000:
    Max Throughput=300MB/s
    Max Capacity=1500 GB

    Volumes:

    Volume1=100 GB (With Snapshot settings with max_snapshot = 3,frequency=30secs)
    Volume2=75 GB (With Snapshot settings with max_snapshot = 5,frequency=45secs)
    Volume3=600 GB

    Hosts:
    Host1 
    Host2 
        

3. High latency due to high system capacity(Snapshot Overload)

System 5000:
    Max Throughput=350MB/s
    Max Capacity=2000 GB

    Volumes:

    Volume1=250 GB (With Snapshot settings with max_snapshot = 2,frequency=30secs)
    Volume2=100 GB (With Snapshot settings with max_snapshot = 4,frequency=30secs)
    Volume3=125 GB (With Snapshot settings with max_snapshot = 6,frequency=30secs)

    Hosts:
    Host1 
    Host2 

    Export Volumes:
        Volume1,Host1, workload_size(4KB)

2. High latency due to replication link issues

System 5000:
    Max Throughput=350MB/s
    Max Capacity=1500 GB

    Volumes:

    Volume1=100 GB 
    (With Replication settings with Synchronous,Target system 5001)

    Hosts:
    Host1 

    Export Volumes:
        Volume1,Host1, workload_size(8KB)


System 5001:
    Max Throughput=250MB/s
    Max Capacity=2500 GB
